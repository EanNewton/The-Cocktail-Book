# Rob Roy

## Ingredients

* 2 measures Scotch whisky
* 1 measure sweet vermouth
* 1 dash Angostura bitters

## Steps

1.  Stir the liquor in a mixing glass with ice. Either pour it straight into a rocks glass, or strain into a cocktail glass and serve. Decorate with a maraschino cherry.

## Note
Many an amateur barman has been caught out with a Rob Roy because it is not well known. This is made in just the same way as a Manhattan, but Scotch is used instead of rye whiskey.
