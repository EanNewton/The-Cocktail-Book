## Ingredients

* 1 measure Cointreau or Triple Sec
* 2 measures lemon juice
* 4 measures brandy
* 2 dashes grenadine

## Steps

1.  Place 3-4 ice cubes into the shaker, then pour in the ingredients. Shake vigorously and pour ice and liquor into a highball glass or small tankard. Decorate the glass with a slice of lemon, sprig of mint (if available), a cocktail cherry and two straws. 
2.  Obviously, from the name of the cocktail and its ingredients, you can see that it will definitely keep out the winter's chill -- but not to be taken before attempting the slopes!
