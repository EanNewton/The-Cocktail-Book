## Ingredients

* 1 measure clear honey
* 1/2 measure lemon juice
* 2-3 measures water

## Steps

1.  Place the ingredients in a saucepan and slowly bring to a boil, or heat until the honey has dissolved completely. Pour into a rocks glass with a teaspoon in it (this prevents the glass cracking if the liquor is too hot).
2.  This is not only an extremely warming drink during the winter months, but is also a remedy for colds and influenza. It may not get rid of your cold completely, but it certainly makes it a little more bearable!
