# MARTINIS

Surely the most well known of all cocktails and yet probably the most abused, for although making a Martini is simple, it still needs care. Martinis, of course, can be served straight up or on the rocks according to taste. The classic Martini is based on gin, but you can make a Vodka Martini or Vodkatini, popularized in recent years by James Bond -- or even a tequila martini.
