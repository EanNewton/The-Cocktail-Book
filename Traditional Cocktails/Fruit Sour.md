* 1 measure fruit liqueur of choice
* 1 measure lemon juice

## Steps

1.  Make as a Whisky Sour. The sugar has been left out of the ingredients as fruit liqueur is sweet enough on its own.
2.  Sours are generally served on the rocks and decorated with a slice of orange, a maraschino cherry, and 2 thin straws.
