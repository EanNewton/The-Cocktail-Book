# Fruit Daquiri

Since the advent of the original Daquiri, frozen fruit Daquiris have become increasingly popular. It is advisable to use the same fruit as the fruit liqueur. Any fruit of your choice may be used for flavouring a Daquiri this way, but please remember first to skin the fruit before placing it in a blender, otherwise the cocktail will end up with an extremely bitter taste.
